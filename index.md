Legit is an unincorporated association that aims to help young men get back into society after brushing with the criminal justice system. We have a mentoring cycle so anyone who is a client of ours is also a volunteer who can mentor the next guy. We mentor through volunteering at different events around London, look out for next one and get in touch (getintouchlegit@gmail.com) if you want to collaborate on an event.
